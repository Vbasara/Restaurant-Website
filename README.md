# Web Applications Class
I was tasked with creating a a searchable menu in PHP for a Restaurant called "Eden from the Rock"
Using mySql I also filled the database with menu items and then proceeded to create a login page for the Admin.


 My classmates created the rest of the necessary components. 
The menu was succesfully installed and properly pulled updated information from the database.
