# Web Applications Class Final Project

### Course: CIS-431

## Description
   I was tasked with creating a a searchable menu in PHP for a Restaurant called "Eden from the Rock". In Search.php I made sure to throw an error whenever the user input does not match any of the item names in the database.
I filled the database on phpMyAdmin with menu items using Sql and then proceeded to create a login page for the Restaurant Admin.

 My classmates created the rest of the necessary components which included the homepage, order placement page,etc.  
The menu I designed was succesfully installed and properly pulled updated information from the database.
